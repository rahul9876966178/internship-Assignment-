### to get valid endpoints do a get request on "/"
expected output->
```
{"valid-endpoints": [
   {"GET": "/api/getURL"},
   {"POST": "/api/getInteractions"}
]}
```

### 1) api/getUrl

sends the url of the client we are connected to in interact-client

![getUrl](images/get.png)

### 2) api/getInteractions

before sending this API request make some interactions to the interactsh-client in a different terminal

```
    ex: ping 'url'
```

sends a list of all interactions made to the specific link
